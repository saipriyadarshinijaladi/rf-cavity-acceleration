# ⚡ RF Cavity Particle Acceleration Visualizer

A simple Python + Matplotlib simulation of a charged particle being accelerated through an RF cavity — just like in linear accelerators at CERN.

🎯 **Features:**
- Time-varying E-field: `E(x, t) = sin(kx) * cos(ωt)`
- Particle enters the cavity and responds to the field
- Particle dot **grows in size** with velocity (energy gain visualized)
- Velocity vs Time graph shows acceleration dynamics

🧠 **Built with:**
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab (Jupyter Notebook)
- Basic physics: EM waves, Newton's laws

📺 **Demo Animation:**

🔬 *Inspired by RF cavity acceleration techniques used in particle accelerators like the LHC and LINACs at CERN.*
